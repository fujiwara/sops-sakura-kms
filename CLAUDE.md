This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

sops-sakura-kms is a SOPS wrapper that enables SOPS to use Sakura Cloud KMS for data key encryption. It acts as a Vault Transit Engine compatible HTTP server, allowing SOPS to encrypt and decrypt data keys using Sakura Cloud KMS through the `--hc-vault-transit` option.

The tool automatically:
1. Starts a local Vault Transit Engine compatible HTTP server
2. Configures SOPS with the correct `--hc-vault-transit` flag
3. Executes SOPS with proper environment variables
4. Handles encryption/decryption requests from SOPS using Sakura Cloud KMS

## Architecture

### Wrapper Mode (Primary Use Case)
The tool operates as a SOPS wrapper via `RunWrapper()` function:
- Reads `SAKURACLOUD_KMS_KEY_ID` environment variable (12-digit Sakura Cloud resource ID as string)
- Validates that `--hc-vault-transit` is not manually specified (returns error if it is)
- Starts HTTP server on `127.0.0.1:8200` in background
- Waits for server health check (30 retries Ã— 100ms)
- Automatically injects `--hc-vault-transit http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/transit/encrypt/{key_id}` argument
- Sets `VAULT_ADDR` and `VAULT_TOKEN` environment variables
- Executes SOPS command with all original arguments

### API Endpoints
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint (returns 200 OK)
- `PUT /v1/transit/encrypt/{key_id}` - Encrypts plaintext using Sakura Cloud KMS
- `PUT /v1/transit/decrypt/{key_id}` - Decrypts ciphertext using Sakura Cloud KMS

### Key Components
- **main.go**: HTTP server setup, handlers, and `RunWrapper()` implementation
  - `NewMux(cipher Cipher)`: Creates HTTP ServeMux with all endpoints
  - `RunWrapper(ctx, sopsArgs)`: Main wrapper function
  - `EncryptHandlerFunc(cipher)`: Encrypt endpoint handler
  - `DecryptHandlerFunc(cipher)`: Decrypt endpoint handler
  - `waitForServer()`: Polls health endpoint until ready
- **cipher.go**: `Cipher` interface and `SakuraKMS` implementation
  - Uses `github.com/sacloud/kms-api-go` for Sakura Cloud KMS API
  - Encrypts with AES-256-GCM algorithm
- **types.go**: Vault Transit Engine compatible request/response types
  - All plaintext/ciphertext are base64-encoded strings for Vault API compatibility
- **cmd/sops-sakura-kms/main.go**: CLI entrypoint that calls `RunWrapper()`

### Data Format
- **Ciphertext prefix**: All encrypted data includes `vault:v1:` prefix for SOPS/Vault compatibility
- **Base64 encoding**: Plaintext and ciphertext are base64-encoded in API requests/responses
- **Key ID format**: Sakura Cloud KMS resource ID is a 12-digit number (treated as string)

## Development Commands

### Build
```bash
make                    # Build binary to ./sops-sakura-kms
go build -o sops-sakura-kms ./cmd/sops-sakura-kms
```

### Test
```bash
make test              # Run all tests
go test -v ./...       # Run all tests with verbose output
go test -race ./...    # Run tests with race detector (used in CI)
```

Set `KEY_ID` environment variable to run integration tests that actually call Sakura Cloud KMS API.

### Install
```bash
make install           # Install to $GOPATH/bin
```

### Release Build
```bash
make dist              # Build release binaries with goreleaser (snapshot mode)
goreleaser build --snapshot --clean
```

## Testing Notes

### Test Structure
- **handler_test.go**: HTTP handler tests using mock cipher
  - Uses `mockCipher` that base64-encodes for encrypt, base64-decodes for decrypt
  - Tests all endpoints including error cases
  - Uses `NewMux()` to ensure consistency with production routing
- **vault_compat_test.go**: Vault API client compatibility tests
  - Uses `github.com/hashicorp/vault/api` client to verify compatibility
  - Tests base64 encoding/decoding flow matches Vault Transit Engine behavior
- **wrapper_test.go**: `RunWrapper()` function tests
  - Tests environment variable validation
  - Tests `--hc-vault-transit` conflict detection
  - Does not test full SOPS integration (requires SOPS binary)
- **kms_test.go**: Integration tests with actual Sakura Cloud KMS
  - Requires `KEY_ID` environment variable (12-digit resource ID)
  - Skipped if `KEY_ID` is not set
  - Tests real encryption/decryption with Sakura Cloud KMS

### Key Testing Principles
- Mock cipher for unit tests (no external dependencies)
- All tests use `NewMux()` to create handlers consistently
- Integration tests can be skipped without blocking development
- Error handling is thoroughly tested (invalid JSON, missing prefix, etc.)

## Important Design Decisions

### Why Wrapper Mode?
SOPS does not support passing `--hc-vault-transit` via environment variables. The only ways to configure it are:
1. Command-line flag: `--hc-vault-transit <uri>`
2. Configuration file: `.sops.yaml` with `hc_vault_transit_uri`

Since we need dynamic configuration based on `SAKURACLOUD_KMS_KEY_ID`, the wrapper approach automatically injects the flag.

### Why Prevent Manual `--hc-vault-transit`?
If users manually specify `--hc-vault-transit`, it conflicts with the wrapper's automatic configuration. The tool explicitly checks for this and returns an error to prevent confusion.

### Error Handling Best Practices
- JSON encoding errors in response handlers are logged but not fatal (connection may be closed)
- Server startup errors are captured via channel to detect port conflicts
- `http.ErrServerClosed` is ignored (normal shutdown)
- Health check retries 30 times with 100ms intervals (max 3 seconds)

### Constants
- `VaultPrefix = "vault:v1:"` - Required by SOPS for Vault Transit Engine compatibility
- `KeyIDPathParam = "key_id"` - URL path parameter name
- `EnvKeyID = "SAKURACLOUD_KMS_KEY_ID"` - Environment variable for KMS resource ID
- `ServerAddr = "127.0.0.1:8200"` - Standard Vault server address (localhost only)

## Go Version

This project uses Go 1.24+ (as specified in go.mod). CI tests against Go 1.23 and 1.24.
